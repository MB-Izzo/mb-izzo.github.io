Today, I feel that I canbe the <strong>owner of features</strong>, with my <strong>amazing lead</strong> always looking to help me ifneeded.</p><p>I also realized that <strong>people here seems to trust me</strong>. They come to me to askfor help, sometimes on a subject I’m not closely related to.</p><p><strong>How?</strong> I don’t know. I think I’m just <strong>curious enough</strong> and loving my work enough soI naturally want to do my best and help people around me. I’m nothing of agenius and I’m far from being the best programmer in the company, very far. Butstill, just doing my best seems enough. <strong>No need to be a genius</strong>.

It’s pricey, butI don’t regret this one.</p><p>It forced me to learn touch typing, all that while learning <em>Dvorak</em> layout.I’m not faster than before, but I feel way more comfortable typing now. <strong>I feelit’s easier on my hands and arms</strong>.
