**2023 is over. Welcome 2024.** It's that time of the year again, that I encourage
you to do to: write down what you did this year. It always makes me feel better.
Now get ready to some good old bragging (again)!

## Shipped a AAA game

It's been almost 3 years at my job, and in September, **the game I've worked on
finally shipped!** It's a cool achievement, and **the release week felt very special**,
it's a dream coming true. I can not wait to see how we're going to make the game
better over time, and now the challenge of "live maintenance" starts. It's a new
way to work, so it's always a good thing for my experience.

## Learned (a bit of) game engine development

I've always wanted to make my own game engine but never thought I was skilled enough.
After two tries this year, I made something I'm *kind of* happy about. I learned to
make a **simple 2D renderer with OpenGL**, and plenty of C++ stuff. I've started to go
down the rabbit hole of **Graphics Programming**, but stopped too early because of a lack
of math skills. I really **need to get better at math this year**, to do a third try
on making my own game engine.

## Started learning Rust

It's the new cool kid in town, so I had to learn it a bit. I created a very simple
roguelike with the help of a library made for that purpose. Then I tried to tinker
with **macroquad** to make very simple games. It helped me to learn a bit about Rust and
become more familiar with the Rust ecosystem.

I also made a simple **static site generator** with it, which was a cool project
overall that I recommend to anyone curious about it!

## Did more web dev

Last year, I got more familiar with web development. This year, it all clicked. 
I did more front-end and back-end dev at work, which improved my skills a ton. I'm
now very comfortable with coding a simple backend, whatever the language is. Which led
me to learn a bit about...

### ...Golang

Golang is fun! I did a simple REST API with it, and it helped me to learn more about
the language. But the funniest project I did with it was a simple **todos manager, how 
original**.

I made it for work, and linked it to our Jira, because I think the **jira web interface 
is too slow for me**, and I hate going to the Jira website just to know what I need to do,
it disrupts my workflow too much. **So I made this todo tool to handle all this in my terminal**,
**which made my life a tiny bit better at work**.

## Did one gamejam with a friend

I've played a lot of Persona 5 this year and it really reignited my love for games (and
for gamedev). So I did a gamejam with a friend and ultimately, we handed making a very
poor version of Persona 5 turn by turn fights. It was fun because I hadn't touched Unity
since a very long time, so it was the opportunity for me to get back at it!

## Godot

I started learning Godot, **even before the Unity fees drama**, just because I hate how
slow Unity became. Godot is lightweight and fast. **It lacks some important stuff in my opinion**,
and have some really rough edges here and there. I like it, but **I can't imagine myself using
it for a very serious project now**, but I will definetely keep an eye on it from now on and
**I might use for smaller projects**.

## Wrap-up

I am very happy about my progress this year, and I feel I am finally on my way to become
a better programmer. Experience really makes the difference, and **having good mentors too.**
**With the right people around us, we go faster, further, and we have fun with it!**

Which leads me to think that I better start posting more here, and start sharing my 
thoughts and knowledge more regularly!

Stay tuned!
