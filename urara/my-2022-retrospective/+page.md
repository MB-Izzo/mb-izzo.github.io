**2022 is over. Welcome 2023.** I thought this year was empty for me, but when
writing down a list of what I've done this year, I realized I learned many things.
I'm not going to talk about personal stuff, but I'll write about
**what I learned on computers.**

Now get ready to some good old bragging!

## Became better at my job

May 2022 marked my first year at my job. After one year, I felt that I started
to understand the complexity of working on AAA games. Today, I feel that I can
be the **owner of features**, with my **amazing lead** always looking to help me if
needed.

I also realized that **people here seems to trust me**. They come to me to ask
for help, sometimes on a subject I'm not closely related to.

**How?** I don't know. I think I'm just **curious enough** and loving my work enough so
I naturally want to do my best and help people around me. I'm nothing of a
genius and I'm far from being the best programmer in the company, very far. But
still, just doing my best seems enough. **No need to be a genius**. What a relief.

## Learned web development

### Front-end

Front-end, I learned at work with a project I completed from A to Z with **React**.
I'm very thankful for my lead, because he let me start this project and trusted
me 100%. I had no prior experience with front-end dev, and still **he trusted that
I could achieve this project**. It's a dashboard app that is now useful to a dozen
of people everyday at my job.

I realized I was coming to a place where **I can learn a tech and deliver something
with it, by myself**. What a relief.

### Back-end

This was a personal challenge. For no specific reasons, I wanted to be able to
**develop a simple back-end**. I just want to be able to code a web app by myself, if
one day I have an idea that needs it.

I have nothing to show yet, but **I'm confident enough that I can build a simple
full-stack app**, and I'll talk about my first project on this blog soon.

**Disclaimer**: of course, I have no idea how to make things scalable and stuff like
that, I'm just saying I would be able to develop small personal projects, not
professional web apps.

## Figma and UI/UX Design

**I always wanted to be able to do anything**, at least just a bit. UI and UX Design
are difficult subjects for me, mostly because **I don't think I'm an artist at all**.
So I learned the basics, just to make stuff that looks at least _correct_.

The book [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) helped me a lot. It's
specifically made for programmers that are not UI/UX designers. A book I
recommend, **because the greatest software is useless without proper UX**.

## Switched to Dvorak layout and bought a split keyboard.

First, let me tell you that a **split keyboard is life-changing**. It's pricey, but
I don't regret this one.

It forced me to learn touch typing, all that while learning _Dvorak_ layout.
I'm not faster than before, but I feel way more comfortable typing now. **I feel
it's easier on my hands and arms**. My body is thankful.

## Bought a vertical mouse.

Just do it. **Do it for your wrists**. Trust me on this one. And keep that expensive
gaming mouse for when you want to play games.

## Neovim and Linux workflow

Neovim also changed my developer experience. It took a couple of months to get
used to but it was worth it. Combined with a split keyboard, my programming
workflow is just so smooth.

Combine neovim with linux, i3wm, tmux... **and you never want to go back again**.

I'll write a post with more details about my workflow.

## Wrap-up

Overall, this year was all about having a better developer experience and learning
about webdev.

**I became a better programmer, and hope to become better this year too!**
