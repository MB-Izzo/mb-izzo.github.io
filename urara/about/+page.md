Hi, **I'm I2zo**, welcome on my blog. I am a programmer,
**currently working at Ubisoft.**
My job title is **QA Engineer**.  
The responsabilities for this kind of role
may vary from a company to another, but to be brief, I **mostly develop tools**
to help testing with automation. I work along DevOps and gameplay programmers.
I mostly use C++ and C# at my job.

Before that, I founded a company with some friends,
[Tales Up](https://talesup.io/?lang=en), a narrative multiplayer mobile game.
I developed the game with **React Native**, and made some importants programming
decisions that were probably very bad as I had no experience and I am a
**self taught** programmer.

## Skills

I like to tinker with all kind of technologies and experiment. I have the most
experience with C#, but you will find below all the tech I tinker(ed) with.  
I received a **game design degree**, but I **taught myself programming** since almost
10 years.

## Tech and languages I work with

- C#
- C++
- React / React Native
- TypeScript
- Neovim
- Rust
- Python
- Lua
